About my practice game!

Hi! This README will probably contain more when I'm done with things, as I'll explain each of the things below:

Art needs:

[ ] Player Sprite and animation

[ ] Background environment

[ ] Enemy Sprites and animations (behaviors)

[ ] Weapons Sprites and animations

[ ] Collectibles Sprites and animations

[ ] Inventory Sprites

Coding needs:

[ ] Animation system

[ ] Background paralax (I don't think I spelled that right)

[ ] Inventory System

[ ] I'm tired of listing things
